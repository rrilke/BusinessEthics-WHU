\begin{itemize}
  \item Participants of an Experiment were asked to rate the judgements for the Self and the average person (Other) were provided on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much so).
  \item The mean scores for Self are generally higher for positive traits and lower for negative traits when compared to ratings for Others, indicating a tendency for individuals to view themselves in a more favorable light.

\frametitle{What is Moral?}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Origin:} \textit{moralis} (Latin) — concerning custom; \textit{mos, mores} — custom(s)
    \item \textbf{Definition:} A system of norms that guide human behavior
    \item \textbf{Claim:} These norms have an \textcolor{WHUblue}{unconditional claim to validity}
  \end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Moral Judgments:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{WHUblue}{\textbf{Moral}} = morally good
  \item \textcolor{WHUblue}{\textbf{Immoral}} = morally evil, wrong, bad
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Types of Norms:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Moral norms}

\textit{
"How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it. Of this kind is \textbf{pity or compassion}, the emotion which we feel for the misery of others, when we either see it, or are made to conceive it in a very lively manner. That we often derive \textcolor{WHUblue}{sorrow from the sorrow of others}, is a matter of fact too obvious to require any instances to prove it; for this sentiment, like all the other original passions of human nature, is by no means confined to the virtuous and humane, though they perhaps may feel it with the most exquisite sensibility. \textcolor{WHUblue}{The greatest ruffian, the most hardened violator of the laws of society, is not altogether without it.}"

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Key Principles:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Intergenerational equity: Balancing current and future needs.
  \item Integration of economic, environmental, and social considerations.
  \item Long-term planning and responsible resource management.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}

\begin{frame}{Stakeholder Theory}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=WHUblue!5!white, colframe=WHUblue, title=Definition, fonttitle=\bfseries, sharp corners=south]

\end{tcolorbox}

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Key Points:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Emphasizes ethical obligations to all parties affected by business operations.
  \item Encourages long-term value creation and trust-building.
  \item Forms the ethical foundation for ESG and CSR initiatives.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=WHUblue!5!white, colframe=WHUblue, title=The Dieselgate Scandal, fonttitle=\bfseries, sharp corners=south]
\textbf{Volkswagen (VW) installed software in millions of diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests, allowing cars to pass regulatory standards while emitting pollutants far above legal limits during real-world driving.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Why is Dieselgate a Tension Point for Business Ethics?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Profit vs. Principle:} Volkswagen chose to increase sales and profits by cheating emissions tests, instead of following legal and ethical standards.
  \item \textbf{Short-term Gain, Long-term Risk:} The company’s decision to deceive regulators and consumers brought immediate financial benefits, but ultimately resulted in billions in fines, criminal charges, and lasting reputational harm.
  \item \textbf{Systemic Issues:} The scandal was not just the result of a few bad actors—it reflected deeper problems in VW’s corporate culture, incentive structures, and industry-wide pressures that encouraged unethical behavior.

\textbf{Ethical Tensions and Stakeholder Impact:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pro-Social Motivation:} Volkswagen publicly promoted its commitment to environmental protection and innovation by developing “clean diesel” vehicles.
  \item \textbf{Unethical Means to Noble Ends:} Although the company aimed to achieve environmental goals, it used deceptive software to cheat emissions tests, violating ethical and legal standards.
  \item \textbf{Negative Stakeholder Impact:} The deception harmed multiple stakeholders—including customers (misled about emissions), regulators (undermined trust), the environment (increased pollution), and public health (higher exposure to pollutants).
  \item \textbf{Ethical Lesson:} Positive intentions or goals do not excuse unethical actions; both the means and the ends must be ethically sound.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=WHUblue!5!white, colframe=WHUblue, title=The Traditional View, fonttitle=\bfseries, sharp corners=south]
“In neoclassical thinking, a requirement for social improvement [...] imposes a constraint on the corporation. Adding a constraint to the firm that is already maximizing profits, says the theory, will inevitably raise costs and reduce profits.”

\vspace{0.5em}

Corporate responsibility programs—reaction to external pressure—have emerged largely to improve firms’ reputations and are treated as a necessary expense. Anything more is seen by many as an irresponsible use of shareholders’ money.

\textcolor{WHUblue}{\textbf{“The concept of shared value, in contrast, recognizes that societal needs, not just conventional economic needs, define markets. It also recognizes that social harms or weaknesses frequently create internal costs for firms.”}}

\vspace{0.7em}

...companies have overlooked opportunities to meet fundamental societal needs and misunderstood how societal harms and weaknesses affect value chains. Our field of vision has simply been too narrow.

\vspace{0.7em}

\textcolor{WHUblue}{\textbf{“Companies can create economic value by creating societal value. There are three distinct ways to do this: by reconceiving products and markets, redefining productivity in the value chain, and building supportive industry clusters at the company’s locations.”}}

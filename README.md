# Business Ethics

## Course Description

Business ethics is concerned with the principles and standards that guide behavior in the world of commerce. Traditionally, the field explores normative questions about how individuals and organizations ought to act in business contexts. This course introduces students to the central theories, concepts, and dilemmas in business ethics, spanning both philosophical and applied perspectives.

A core objective of the course is to equip students with the tools to critically assess ethical challenges in business life. To this end, we will explore a range of normative ethical frameworks—including deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics—and apply them to real-world business cases involving topics such as corporate responsibility, whistleblowing, sustainability, and stakeholder conflicts.

In addition to these normative foundations, the course integrates insights from the behavioral sciences. Behavioral business ethics helps us understand how and why individuals and organizations sometimes fall short of ethical standards, despite good intentions. We will examine empirical findings on ethical blind spots, decision-making biases, and the influence of context and incentives on ethical behavior.

Through a combination of classic readings, contemporary research, and practical case studies, students will develop a well-rounded understanding of business ethics that bridges theory and practice. The course ultimately aims to foster ethical awareness and responsible decision-making in complex business environments.

## Policies

### Attendance
Attendance is not only a requirement but a sign of respect and support for your peers. Each student is expected to attend all presentations, as they provide a valuable opportunity to learn from one another and engage in critical discussions that will enhance everyone's understanding of the content. Please note, consistent attendance is a component of your final grade, and absence without a valid reason may result in a deduction of points. Make your presence a priority; it contributes significantly to the collective learning experience of the class.

### Electronic Devices During Presentations and Lectures
To maintain a respectful and productive learning environment, the use of laptops, tablets, and other electronic devices is strictly regulated during class sessions, particularly your peers' presentations. Active listening and engagement are critical for the collective benefit of all class members, and as such, devices are to be used only when required for online learning tools as requested by presenting peers.
Building upon this classroom standard, insights from the study "From Distraction to Dedication: Commitment Against Phone Use in the Classroom" emphasize the significant impact that disciplined device usage can have on academic focus and performance (Akşoy et al., 2023). The study presents evidence that proactive measures to limit device use can lead to improvements in attention, participation, and overall academic success. In support of these findings, students are encouraged to adopt commitment devices and strategies to manage their phone and device usage constructively. 
Any student found using devices without explicit permission or necessity will face a deduction in their participation grade. This policy is designed to enhance your educational experience by fostering a distraction-minimized environment that empirical research has shown to be beneficial for learning outcomes. We appreciate your cooperation in upholding these standards to ensure a conducive atmosphere for everyone's learning and academic advancement.

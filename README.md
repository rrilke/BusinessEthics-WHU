# Business Ethics

## Course Description

Business ethics is concerned with the principles and standards that guide behavior in the world of commerce. Traditionally, the field explores normative questions about how individuals and organizations ought to act in business contexts. This course introduces students to the central theories, concepts, and dilemmas in business ethics, spanning both philosophical and applied perspectives.

A core objective of the course is to equip students with the tools to critically assess ethical challenges in business life. To this end, we will explore a range of normative ethical frameworks—including deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics—and apply them to real-world business cases involving topics such as corporate responsibility, whistleblowing, sustainability, and stakeholder conflicts.

In addition to these normative foundations, the course integrates insights from the behavioral sciences. Behavioral business ethics helps us understand how and why individuals and organizations sometimes fall short of ethical standards, despite good intentions. We will examine empirical findings on ethical blind spots, decision-making biases, and the influence of context and incentives on ethical behavior.

Through a combination of classic readings, contemporary research, and practical case studies, students will develop a well-rounded understanding of business ethics that bridges theory and practice. The course ultimately aims to foster ethical awareness and responsible decision-making in complex business environments.

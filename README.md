# Business Ethics

## Course Description

Business ethics is concerned with the principles and standards that guide behavior in the world of commerce. Traditionally, the field explores normative questions about how individuals and organizations ought to act in business contexts. This course introduces students to the central theories, concepts, and dilemmas in business ethics, spanning both philosophical and applied perspectives.

A core objective of the course is to equip students with the tools to critically assess ethical challenges in business life. To this end, we will explore a range of normative ethical frameworks—including deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics—and apply them to real-world business cases involving topics such as corporate responsibility, whistleblowing, sustainability, and stakeholder conflicts.

In addition to these normative foundations, the course integrates insights from the behavioral sciences. Behavioral business ethics helps us understand how and why individuals and organizations sometimes fall short of ethical standards, despite good intentions. We will examine empirical findings on ethical blind spots, decision-making biases, and the influence of context and incentives on ethical behavior.

Through a combination of classic readings, contemporary research, and practical case studies, students will develop a well-rounded understanding of business ethics that bridges theory and practice. The course ultimately aims to foster ethical awareness and responsible decision-making in complex business environments.

## Grading

### Exam
The largest portion of your grade will be determined by your performance on the final exam. The final exam is a 90-minute assessment designed to evaluate your understanding and knowledge of the material covered in the lectures. You can earn up to 100 points on this exam. It may consist of a variety of exercises: one section may include multiple-choice questions that test your familiarity with key definitions and core concepts; another section may require you to summarize and analyze a research paper discussed during the course, demonstrating your understanding of its significance and implications. You may also be asked to examine a business scenario using ethical theories introduced in class or to write a short essay on a selected topic related to the lecture content. The exam is designed to assess both your grasp of theoretical frameworks and your ability to apply ethical reasoning to real-world contexts.

### ChatGPT Exam Question Challenge
As an optional opportunity to earn bonus points, students may submit a set of self-generated exam questions created in collaboration with ChatGPT. The objective of this assignment is twofold: first, to deepen your understanding of the course content by constructing thoughtful, well-designed exam questions; second, to engage critically with the capabilities and limitations of generative AI in academic work.

To receive the full amount of 10 bonus points, each student must submit five original exam-style questions. These questions must vary in difficulty: at least one should test basic conceptual or factual understanding, while others should require more advanced application, reasoning, or critical thinking. The questions must cover different topics discussed in the course and be pedagogically sound—that is, clearly formulated and suitable for an exam context. Both multiple-choice questions and short open-ended questions are acceptable formats. For each question, you must also provide a model answer or solution that demonstrates what a correct student response would look like.

In addition to the questions and answers, your submission must include a detailed documentation of how you used ChatGPT in the question development process. This documentation must include: the exact prompt(s) you used to generate the question, the output(s) you received from ChatGPT, and a short reflection (approximately two to four sentences) describing how you evaluated and possibly adapted the AI-generated content. If you iterated through multiple versions or modified the question substantially, please briefly explain why.

The final document you submit must follow a clear and consistent structure for each of the five questions. Each question block should begin with the exam question itself, followed by the model answer. After that, you should include the prompt(s) you submitted to ChatGPT and the corresponding output(s). Finally, you should add your written reflection on the process. The structure of each question should therefore follow this order: (1) the exam question, (2) the answer, (3) the ChatGPT prompt and output, and (4) the reflection.

Your complete submission should be compiled into a single file in either PDF or Markdown format. Please name your file using the following format: Lastname_Firstname_BonusQuestions.pdf. The deadline for submission is [insert date].

The assignment will be graded out of 10 points. Up to four points will be awarded for the content accuracy and academic quality of the questions, up to two points for their pedagogical clarity and usefulness as exam items, one point for providing a meaningful range of difficulty, two points for the effective and appropriate use of ChatGPT, and one point for the quality and thoughtfulness of your documentation and reflection.

## Policies

### Attendance
Attendance is not only a requirement but a sign of respect and support for your peers. Each student is expected to attend all presentations, as they provide a valuable opportunity to learn from one another and engage in critical discussions that will enhance everyone's understanding of the content. Please note, consistent attendance is a component of your final grade, and absence without a valid reason may result in a deduction of points. Make your presence a priority; it contributes significantly to the collective learning experience of the class.

### Electronic Devices During Presentations and Lectures
To maintain a respectful and productive learning environment, the use of laptops, tablets, and other electronic devices is strictly regulated during class sessions, particularly your peers' presentations. Active listening and engagement are critical for the collective benefit of all class members, and as such, devices are to be used only when required for online learning tools as requested by presenting peers.
Building upon this classroom standard, insights from the study "From Distraction to Dedication: Commitment Against Phone Use in the Classroom" emphasize the significant impact that disciplined device usage can have on academic focus and performance (Akşoy et al., 2023). The study presents evidence that proactive measures to limit device use can lead to improvements in attention, participation, and overall academic success. In support of these findings, students are encouraged to adopt commitment devices and strategies to manage their phone and device usage constructively. 
Any student found using devices without explicit permission or necessity will face a deduction in their participation grade. This policy is designed to enhance your educational experience by fostering a distraction-minimized environment that empirical research has shown to be beneficial for learning outcomes. We appreciate your cooperation in upholding these standards to ensure a conducive atmosphere for everyone's learning and academic advancement.
